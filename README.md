# MyDotfiles
My dotfiles inspired by DT

# Past twm. 
I used Xmonad in the past and i think is the most customizible twm in the world now. There is only one problem: haskell. Haskell is not a bad language but is very difficult ot get in and nobady teach that except in the university. So i dropped it for a while in favor of qtile. 

# What is qtile?
Qtile is a twm written in python. It is very small but hight customizible. It is written in python and i love this thing. if you wanna more information just look my config.

## Vim
i added some plugins for trasform nvim in a semi-ide for quick edit, with a theme that match with my general theme (nordic)

## Emacs
Doom Emacs is my default ide. I program with it and i found it perfect. I added only a few packages for new languages and the nordic theme ( beacouse i found it fantastic and match up with all sistem)

## Qutebrowser
I added only a custom theme and a custom start page inspired from dt. The custom theme is, obviusly, nordic, modified a bit mixing with dracula for a better navigation

## Alacritty
Alacritty is my terminal. I found it very quick in tasks and customizable. I edit yaml file to match up with my nordic theme

## Vimb
The replace of qutebrowser. I am testing it beacouse is quite faster then other browser i ever seen but have some problems. If it's becaming very difficult to use i would re-switch to qute

### Polybar
polybar is the best bar for any wm. Is a bit bloat but looks absolutely gorgeous !
