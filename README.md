# MyDotfiles
My dotfiles inspired by DT

## Xmonad
My xmonad, also inspired by dt but colorazied in different way and customizable to be more slim, is my main wm beacouse it is a lot powerfull and customizable. I know xmonad is a lot difficult to learn beacouse is written in haskell but i recomend you to learn something to enjoy the power of this twm. 
### The problem of xmonad
As I have already anticipated, Xmonad is quite difficult to configure so i added another wm i use for backup twm

## awesomewm 
My awesome wm is quite inspired, as i alredy saw, but i modified my theme with a custom ( powerarrow orange), and modified the keybindings with some more appropriate to me.
### Why awesome?
I chose to display an awesomewm rice beacouse is a dinamyc twm writen in lua and hight customizable, but also quite simple. I don' t chose qtile beacouse simply i 
discover this as more functional and expandable, and also on my system qtile don't wanna boot XDXD

## Vim
i added some plugins for trasform nvim in a semi-ide for quick edit, with a theme that match with my general theme (palenight)

## Emacs
Doom Emacs is my default ide. I program with it and i found it perfect. I added only a few packages for new languages and the palenight theme ( beacouse i found it fantastic and match up with all sistem)

## Qutebrowser
I added only a custom theme and a custom start page inspired from dt. The custom theme is, obviusly, palenight, modified a bit mixing with dracula for a better navigation

## Alacritty
Alacritty is my terminal. I found it very quick in tasks and customizable. I edit yaml file to match up with my palenight theme
