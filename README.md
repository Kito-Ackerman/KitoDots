My dotfiles inspired by DT

## Past twm.

I used Xmonad in the past and i think is the most customizible twm in the world now. There is only one problem: haskell. Haskell is not a bad language but is very difficult to get in and is very difficult to learn exept with special courses like university courses. So i dropped it for a while in favor of qtile.

## What is qtile?

Qtile is a very small but hight customizible dynamic tiling window manager. It is written in python and i love this thing. if you wanna more information just look my config (README.org).

## Vim

i added some plugins for trasform nvim in a semi-ide for quick edit, with a theme that match with my general theme (gruvbox)

## Emacs

Doom Emacs is my default ide. I program with it and i found it perfect. I added only a few packages for new languages and the gruvbox theme ( beacouse i found it fantastic and match up with all sistem)

## Qutebrowser

I added only a custom theme and a custom start page. The custom theme is, obviusly, gruvbox, modified a bit mixing it with dracula for a better navigation

## Alacritty

Alacritty is my terminal. I found it very quick in tasks and customizable. I edit yaml file to match up with my gruvbox theme
